# Status

**This project is unmaintained**. It was originally spun off of
django-auth-ldap, which no longer requires it. If you have a use for it, feel
free to copy the code for your own purposes (it's only for testing, after all).


# mockldap

This project provides a mock replacement for python-ldap. It's useful for any
project that would like to write unit tests against LDAP code without relying
on a running LDAP server.
